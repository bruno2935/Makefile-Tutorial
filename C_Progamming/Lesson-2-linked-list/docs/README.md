# Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that represents a collection of elements, where each element (**node**) contains two fields: one for storing the data and another for storing a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list. The first node of the list is called the **head**, and the last node has a reference to a null value, indicating the end of the list.
